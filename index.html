    <p><em>an affordable alternative to acing your coding interviews</em></p>
    <p class="details">
        AceCode offers you an all in one package. No longer do you have to purchase seperate resources to prep for the coding interview.
        Everything you need is on AceCode. If you're new to coding interviews then we have you covered with our curriculum which covers all of
        the algorithms and data structures that you'll require to optimise your code in the interview. On top of this we provide you with a roster of coding interview questions
        that vary with difficulty. You'll be able to practice these in our integrated coding environment. If you find it challenging then we always have tools such as video resources
        attached to each question to help you when you need! This site is being updated constantly so stay tuned for updates.
